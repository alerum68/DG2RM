Version 2.00:

Just run the script and specify the filename of the DNAGedcom and RootsMagic 10 Databases. Current version will create records for your Ancestry, FTDNA, and MyHeritage profiles, and records for your Ancestry matches with entries in the DNATable, and a DNA Kit event added.  Duplication is partially handled. Will need to do a SmartMerge in RootsMagic.
